# MyReads Project

This is the finished application for Udacity book tracking using react.
## TL;DR

With the help of the API provided for me from Udacity [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

# What I Learned

* React, React Router, Handling API's, Seperation of concerns, controlled components.
